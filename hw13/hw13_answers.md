# HW13 Questions

1. Please submit the time it took you to train the model along with the final accuracy top1/top5 that you were able to achieve.
  - The model took roughly 20 hours to train, with a final accuracy top1 @ 87.84% and top 5 @ 61.73.

2. Could you increase the batch size? Why? How long did the training take you? Please save your trained model, we'll use it for the lab.
  - I could have modified that batch size to speed things up, but I would need to tune it so that I don't load too much into memory. This would likely take a bit of trial and error.
